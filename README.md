## Description

A **content management systems (CMS)** application that allows business individuals to interact with information about their company, stored in a SQL database. The user is able to interact with the app from the terminal, using Inquirer to choose different options as `view all departments`, `add role` or `update employee role`. When the user clicks on one of the options, a promise request is made to access the database and execute the command e.g. `view`, `add` or `update` in the company database. When the promise is executed, the user is prompted with a `console table` presenting the information requested or a success message that information has been updated in the database.
